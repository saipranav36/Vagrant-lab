A.	In this lab, I learnt about what is Vagrant and how it is used. i understood that rather than going into virtual box and creating virtual machines, we can accomplish this by using vagrant. I leant how to deal with Vagrant file which is the most important one. I created single topology and multi-machine topology by using Ubuntu and Centos base images. Furthermore, I learnt how to install Apache server into the machine and ssh into it. Furthermore, I learnt how to sync folders between host and guest machine.
